### Notes on R
- While the above scripts should run fine on your current version of R, it might be a good idea to update R and RStudio if you have not already.
- You can do so by downloading and installing the latest versions for R [here](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/) and RStudio [here](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).
- To make sure the new version of R is running when you open RStudio, go to Tools > Global Options > General, and select the latest version you just downloaded (as of my writing this, that version is 4.4.1). You will have to restart RStudio for it to begin running. The latest version should then be listed at the top of your console.
  
### Notes on linear and generalized linear models
- Aside from a review of implementing OLS and checking assumptions in R, the most important takeaway this week is that we are preparing to move from estimating linear models to estimating generalized linear models (GLMs) using the glm() function and specifying the distribution.
- GLMs generalize the linear model to other distributions besides the normal (Gaussian), such that models with non-continuous Dependent Variables can be estimated.
- While the best unbiased linear model uses OLS to estimate parameter values that minimize residuals, generalized linear models typically estimate parameters that maximize the likelihood of observing our data - a modeling process we call "Maximum Likelihood Estimation" (MLE).

# Week 3: Overview of the Maximum Likelihood Estimator 

### Slides
[MLE Slides](8830_slides/03MLE.pdf)
### Notes
- No R scripts this week, as we are focusing on understanding the logic of MLE and the implications of estimating and interpreting non-linear models.
- Next week, we will begin estimating and interpreting MLE models in R, beginning with binary response models.
- The most important takeaways from this week are the implications of working with non-continuous outcomes and non-linear models:
  - With continous outcomes and linear models, the slope coefficient is constant across values of x for each IV, with other IVs held contant. This makes it much easier to estimate parameters, as minimizing the sum or the squared residuals has a closed-form solution, meaning it is analytically tractible and could be solved by hand for (through we usually use computers).
  - With con-continuous outcomes and non-linear models, we do not have a contstant slope, and the marginal effect of an independent variable is dependent the other IVs and its own values (the entire X matrix). This makes estimating paramaters far more complex, involving much more calculus and computational power. Rather than having a closed-form solution for paramater estimates, numerical optimization techniques are computationally utilized to essentially perform trials and errors until the likelihood function is minimized, discovering the paramater values under which the observed data is most likely to occur.
  - Since we are observing non-linear effects, coefficients are not dirctly interpretable as in OLS (wherein "a 1 unit change in x is associated with a __ unit change in y"). We will discuss in later weeks how in some models we can make these more interpretable by taking their natural log. 
  
# Week 4: Binary Response Miodels

- note the DAMisc package was removed from the CRAN repository. The most recent version can be manually downloaded from the archive [here](https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/DAMisc/) and manually installed with "install.packages("/path_to/Downloads/DAMisc_1.7.2.tar.gz", repos = NULL, type = "source")" replacing the path with the actual path to your Downloads. Otherwise, the script below contains a function written by Russ for computing PRE without an external package.This function has been substituted for the DAMisc function in the Markdown file, but not the R file.

### Notes 
- Remember, we cannot directly interpret logit or probit coefficients, as they are log odds. Instead we focus on their direction and statistical significance. We can exponentiate them to obtain odds ratios, from which we can also obtain predicted probabilities and marginal effects. These can be used to examine the effect sizes of our predictor variables.
- The goodness of fit tests are meant to assess how well models explain the data, but in applied research, our goal is not necessarily to produce a model that best explains the data. Most of the time, in fact, our goal is to test specific relationships. Thus, just because goodness of fit tests suggest that we should remove a variable or throw out a model, does not necessarily mean that we should. If a variable or model is important to testing our hypotheses, controlling for variables, guiding or theory, or providing some other methodological or substantive utility, we should keep it.

### Data
- In the R script above, you will need to import ANES data. The data file is too large to host on github, so I created a dropbox link from which it can be downloaded [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/97wmtao6l30s930chddmm/anes_timeseries_cdf.dta?rlkey=cmn8ax1sm1ua0hvosoahnvnoe&st=lfqe70xu&dl=0) (note: you do not need to sign in to dropbox - click "or continue to download" below the signin window)
